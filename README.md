# How to Play:

1. Fork the Repository
2. Ensure you have Python, npm, and React installed on your machine
3. In the command line, make sure your working directory is at the root of the project, ABCGoose.

### Running Backend

cd database
./runBackend.sh

### Running Frontend

Open another terminal shell, cd into ABCGoose/frontend/app
npm start

5. Click the link generated by npm

## Tasks Completed:

- Built webscraper to reliably find words, definitions, and synonyms
- Created database in SQLite to populate webscraper data
- Built secure backend API with basic Auth to fetch game data
- Converted to fast-rendering and clean React.js + Tailwind.css frontend (model-view-controller paradigm)

## TODO:

- Apply limits on API request endpoints
- Switch from SQLite to either PostGres or No-SQL database like Firestore
- Build and deploy a public API
- Build a Machine Learning Verification Layer for user inputs
- Build more game modes (i.e., User manually changes the time limit)
