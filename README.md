# How to Play:

1. Fork the Repository
2. Ensure you have Python, npm, and React installed on your machine
3. In the command line, cd into ABCGoose/database and run "python3 user.py"
4. Open another terminal shell, cd into ABCGoose/frontend/app, and run "npm run start"
5. Interact with the frontend in the browser

## Tasks Completed:

- Built webscraper to reliably find words, definitions, and synonyms
- Converted to fast-rendering and well maintained React.js + Tailwind.css frontend
- Built secure backend API with basic Auth

## TODO:

- Fix the frontend
- Switch from Tailwind to better project (maybe react typescript with Bootstrap)
- Update the database to include more words and synonyms
- Build word, definition, and synonym verification layer for new words added to database
- Build and deploy a public API from a database hosted cheaply
- Build a Machine Learning Verification Layer for user inputs
- Build more game modes (i.e., User manually changes the time limit)
