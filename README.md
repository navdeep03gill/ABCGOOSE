# How to Play:

1. Fork the Repository
2. Ensure you have Python, npm, and React installed on your machine

## Tasks Completed:

- Built webscraper to reliably find words, definitions, and synonyms
- Created database in SQLite to populate webscraper data
- Built secure backend API with basic Auth to fetch game data
- Converted to fast-rendering and clean React.js + Tailwind.css frontend (model-view-controller paradigm)

## TODO:

- Apply limits on API request endpoints
- Switch from SQLite to either PostGres or No-SQL database like Firestore
- Build and deploy a public API
- Build a Machine Learning Verification Layer for user inputs
- Build more game modes (i.e., User manually changes the time limit)
